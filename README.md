# Simple-Budget-App

A simple budget app i wanted to task myself to make one from scratch to see how far my skills have come.
There are more things i could add, such as adding budget options but i have done this with my ToDo App already.
I could create a more streamlined and impressive "budget bar" like the ones you see on apps so maybe that will be what i add next.

A working example of this simple budget app can be viewed on my CodePen:
